    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>Lavi, our brilliant and endlessly supportive CTO, is the backbone of our team. Whether it's solving complex architecture issues, debugging under pressure, or guiding junior developers, Lavi is always the first to jump in and the last to leave. Now, he needs our help.
    <br><br>
    We're raising funds to equip Lavi with a customized mechanical keyboard and other essential office accessories that will improve his comfort, focus, and efficiency. These aren't luxuries ‚Äî they're the tools he needs to continue working at the high level we all benefit from.
    <br><br>
    Supporting this project means:
    <ul>
      <li>Helping Lavi work without wrist strain and discomfort.</li>
      <li>Boosting productivity through better ergonomic design.</li>
      <li>Showing appreciation for someone who constantly uplifts and supports others.</li>
      <li>Creating a workspace that reflects the care and excellence Lavi brings to everything he does.</li>
    </ul>
    Let‚Äôs show Lavi how much we appreciate his tireless work. Every dollar goes directly to building a happier, healthier, and more productive workspace for someone who deserves it.</p>
